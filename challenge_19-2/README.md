# Challenge 19.2

### Prompt
"Modify your model to include mobility and run it for δ = 0.01 until there are no infected patients. Display the results as in Challenge 19.1."

## Methods
This challenge introduces the concept of mobility, which is the ability for patients to swap positions with other patients on our patient graph. This mobility is represented by δ, which is the probability that a given patient may swap with another patient. 

## Results
